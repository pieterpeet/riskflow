## Single Barrier Options

A single barrier option has an underlying European option that is either knocked in ot knocked out when
the underlying asset price touches the barrier level $H$. At the expiry date, if the option has not
been knocked in then a rebate is paid.

Consider a generalized European option that pays

$$(AS(T)+B)[\delta(S-K)>0],$$

where $A$ and $B$ are constants, $K$ is the strike and $\delta=+1$ for call options ($\delta=-1$ for
put options). Standard options have $A=\delta$ and $B=-\delta K$ with binary options having $A=0$
and $B$ the payoff amount.

Single barrier options are priced with the formulas from Merton, Reiner and Rubinstein. They are a
combination of the following formulas:

$$ V_1(t)=AS(t)e^{(b-r)\tau}\Phi(\delta x_1)+Be^{-rt}\Phi(\delta x_1-\delta\sigma\sqrt\tau)$$

$$ V_2(t)=AS(T)e^{(b-r)\tau}\Phi(\delta x_2)+Be^{-rt}\Phi(\delta x_2-\delta\sigma\sqrt\tau)$$

$$ V_3(t)=AS(T)e^{(b-r)\tau}\Big(\frac{H}{S(t)}\Big)^{2(\mu+1)} \Phi(\eta y_1)+Be^{-r\tau}
\Big(\frac{H}{S(t)}\Big)^{2\mu}\Phi(\eta y_1 - \eta\sigma\sqrt\tau)$$

$$ V_4(t)=AS(T)e^{(b-r)\tau}\Big(\frac{H}{S(t)}\Big)^{2(\mu+1)} \Phi(\eta y_2)+Be^{-r\tau}
\Big(\frac{H}{S(t)}\Big)^{2\mu}\Phi(\eta y_2 - \eta\sigma\sqrt\tau)$$

| Barrier Type      | Condition     | Parameters          | Option Value                 |
| -----------------:|:-------------:| -------------------:| ---------------------------: |
| Down-and-Out Call | $K \gt H$     | $\eta=1,\delta =1$  |$V_1 - V_3$                |
| Down-and-Out Call | $K \le H$     | $\eta=1,\delta=1$   |$V_2 - V_4$                |
| Up-and-Out Call   | $K \gt H$     | $\eta=-1,\delta=1$  |$0$                        |
| Up-and-Out Call   | $K \le H$     | $\eta=-1,\delta=1$  |$V_1 - V_2 + V_3 - V_4$    |
| Down-and-Out Put  | $K \gt H$     | $\eta=1,\delta=-1$  |$V_1 - V_2 + V_3 - V_4$    |
| Down-and-Out Put  | $K \le H$     | $\eta=1,\delta=-1$  |$0$                        |
| Up-and-Out Put    | $K \gt H$     | $\eta=-1,\delta=-1$ |$V_2 - V_4$                |
| Up-and-Out Put    | $K \le H$     | $\eta=-1,\delta=-1$ |$V_1 - V_3$                |

Where $\mu= {(b-\sigma}^2/2)/\sigma^2, \eta=+1$ for down options or $\eta=-1$ for up options, and

$$ x_1=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt\tau}\log\Big(\frac{S(t)}{K}\Big)+(1+\mu)\sigma\sqrt\tau$$

$$ x_2=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt\tau}\log\Big(\frac{S(t)}{H}\Big)+(1+\mu)\sigma\sqrt\tau$$

$$ y_1=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt\tau}\log\Big(\frac{H^2}{S(t)K}\Big)+(1+\mu)\sigma\sqrt\tau$$

$$ y_2=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt\tau}\log\Big(\frac{H}{S(t)}\Big)+(1+\mu)\sigma\sqrt\tau$$

### One touch and No touch Binary Options and Rebates

A one touch binary option pays a fixed amount if the barrier is touched during the life of the option,
otherwise nothing. The two types are:

- Pay the fixed amount when the barrier is touched
- Pay the fixed amount at expiry

A no-touch binary option pays a fixed amount if the barrier is not touched during its life (equivalent
to a fixed amount less a one touch binary option with payment at expiry).

The value of a no touch option is

$$e^{-r\tau}\Big[ \Phi(\eta x_2-\eta\sigma\sqrt\tau)-\Big(\frac{H}{S(t)}\Big)^{2\mu}
\Phi(\eta y_2-\eta\sigma\sqrt\tau) \Big] $$

where $\eta=+1$ for down options or $\eta=-1$ for up options

The value of the one touch option that pays 1 at expiry if S touches the barrier is $e^{-r\tau}$
minus the value of the no-touch option. If it pays 1 when $S$ touches the barrier, then its value is

$$\Big(\frac{H}{S(t)}\Big)^{\mu+\lambda}\Phi(\eta z)+\Big(\frac{H}{S(t)}\Big)^{\mu-\lambda}
\Phi(\eta z-2\eta\lambda\sigma\sqrt\tau))$$

with

$$z=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt\tau}\log\Big(\frac{H}{S(t)}\Big)+\lambda\sigma\sqrt\tau$$

$$\lambda=\sqrt{\mu^2+\frac{2r}{\sigma^2}}$$

Note that $r$ should be floored at $\frac{-(b/\sigma-\sigma/2)^2}{2}$ for $\lambda$ to be defined.
One touch and no touch options have strike $H$.

### Discontinuous Barrier Sampling

Assuming that barriers are not monitored continuously, an adjustment needs to be made to compensate
for discrete sampling. The adjustment is that of [Broadie, Glasserman and Kou.](http://www.columbia.edu/~sk75/mfBGK.pdf)

If the barrier is above the asset, the adjusted barrier rate is $He^{\beta\sigma\sqrt\delta}$
where $\delta$ is the period between observations and $\beta$ is the constant defined by:

$$\beta=\frac{\xi(1/2)}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\approx 0.5826$$

where $\xi$ is the Riemann zeta function. If the barrier is below the asset, the adjusted barrier is
$He^{-\beta\sigma\sqrt\delta}$

## Discrete Asian Options

The payoff of a discrete asian option is max$(\delta(\bar S-K),0)$ at expiry $T$ with:

$$\bar S=\frac{1}{D}\sum_{i=1}^n d_iS(t_i),$$

$t_1,...,t_n$ are the dates defined **Sampling Data**, $d_i$ is the weight assigned to $t_i$,
$D=\sum_{i=1}^n d_i$, $K$ is the strike, and $\delta$ is either $+1$ for a call or $-1$ for a put.

If $t_i \le 0$, then $S(t_i)$ is the known price assigned to $t_i$ in the sampling data list otherwise
it's the initial price factor value.

For valuation date $t$, let $m$ be the smallest index for which $t_{m+1} \gt t$ ($t_{n+1}=\infty$).
Then $\bar S-K=A-\bar K$, with

$$A=\sum_{i=m+1}^n \omega_i S(t_i),$$

$\omega_i=d_i/D$, and $\bar K$ is the adjusted strike:

$$\bar K=K-\sum_{i=1}^m \omega_i S(t_i).$$

Note that the value of $\bar K$ is clipped to be $>0$ should this value be negative (e.g. small 
original strike and large sample paths).The expectation of $S(t_i)$ under the risk-neutral measure 
is the forward price $F(t,t_i)$ with the expectation of $A$ given by:

$$F=\Bbb{E}_t(A)=\sum_{i=m+1}^n \omega_i F(t,t_i).$$

Define:

- $\tau_i=t_i-t$
- $i\wedge j$ to mean $\min(i,j)$
- $cov_t(\log S(t_i),\log S(t_j))=\sigma_{i\wedge j}^2 \tau_{i\wedge j}$
- $var_t(\log S(t_i))=\sigma_i^2 \tau_i$

Assuming the moment matching approach (the idea that a sum of lognormal variables may be represented by
another lognormal variable with the same first and second moments as the sum), $A$ is lognormal and
$var_t(\log A)=v^2$ where $v$ is given by:

$$ F^2 e^{v^2} = \sum_{i,j=m+1}^n \omega_i\omega_j F(t,t_i)F(t,t_j)e^{\sigma^2_{i\wedge j}
\tau_{i\wedge j}},$$

and the option value is

$$\mathcal B_\delta(F,\bar K,v)D(t,T).$$

Assuming a constant carry rate and constant volatility, we can approximate $F(t,t_i)=S(t)e^{b\tau_i}$
and $\sigma_i=\sigma$ where
$\sigma$ is the implied volatility at time $t$ for expiry $T$ and strike $K'$ and,

$$K'=\frac{\bar K}{\sum_{i=m+1}^n \omega_i}$$

## Equity Swaps

Equity swap legs consist of a series of equity swaplets.

### Equity Swaplet

An equity swaplet has:

- a cashflow $A$
- start date $t_0$
- end date $t_1$
- payment date $T$
- a start multiplier $a_0$
- an end multiplier $a_1$
- a dividend multiplier $b$

For cashflow dates $t_0\le t_1\le T$, the equity swaplet pays:

$$A\Big( \frac{a_1 S(t_1)-a_0 S(t_0)+bH(t_0,t_1)}{S(t_0)^a}\Big)$$

at time $T$. where

- $S(t)$ is the equity price
- $H(t_0,t_1)$ is the time-$t_1$ value of dividends per share with ex-dividend date after $t_0$ but on
or before $t_1$
- $a=1$ if the amount type is **Principle** and $a=0$ if the amount type is **Shares**.

The swaplets have $a_0=a_1=1$ and either $b=1$ if **Include Dividends** is **Yes** or $b=0$ otherwise.

The formula used to value the swaplet at $t\le t_0$ is

$$A\Big((a_1-b)\frac{F(t,t_1)}{F(t,t_0)^a}+ \Big( b\frac{D_r(t,t_0)}{D_r(t,t_1)}-a_0\Big)
F(t,t_0)^{1-a}\Big)D(t,T)$$

where:

- $F$ is the forward equity price
- $D$ is the usual discount factor
- $D_r$ is the discount factor from the equity's repo rate

The value of the swaplet at $t_0\le t\lt t_1$ is

$$A\Big(\frac{(a_1-b)F(t,t_1)+ \frac{b(S(t)+H(t_0,t))}{D_r(t,t_1)}-a_0S(t_0)}{S(t_0)^a}\Big)
D(t,T)$$

The value of the swaplet for $t_1\le t\le T$ is the payoff multiplied by $D(t,T)$

When $t\ge t_0$, the dividend payoff $H(t_0,t\wedge t_1)$ is calculated from **Known Dividends**
and/or the simulated spot and forward prices along the current scenario path

**Dividend Timing** is assumed to be **Terminal** i.e. the swaplet pays $\frac{AbH(t_0,t_1)}{S(t_0)^a}$
at time $T$. Dividend timing could also be continuous (i.e. the dividends are settled on their dividend
dates) but that is not currently implemented.
